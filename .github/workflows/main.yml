# # Controls when the workflow will run
# on:
#   # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
#   push:
#     branches: [ main ]
#   pull_request:
#     branches: [ main ]

#   # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# # A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# jobs:
#   # This workflow contains a single job called "build"

#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

#     # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job

#       # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
